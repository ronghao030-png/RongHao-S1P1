            <h2>The Founder's Story</h2>
            <p>
                She had no name.
              People called her “Zero” because she arrived with nothing, and because she always began with silence.
              Zero was born in the wasteland at the edge of the frontier—a gray zone so insignificant it wasn't even marked on maps. There, desolation, restlessness, and hedonism mingled with the savagery of human nature. Sometimes she'd curl up in the cracks behind tin shacks, listening to adults spill fragmented tales into the night, drowning them in alcohol. This was her window to the world.
              Later, she left the wasteland. No one knows how she survived until now. All they know is she opened a tavern—in a quiet corner of the city, like a handful of yellow earth, like a warm bed.

          <h2>Our Tavern's Story</h2>
          <p>
            The proprietress of this tavern, the woman known as Zero. Some say she perished years ago in a riot. Amid the chaos, when others sought to claim her body, a man carried her away—through flames and dust, toward the distant frontier.<br>

            Legend has it that man carried her all the way to the deity who rules over life and death, trading everything he had to reclaim her soul.
            After that, she returned—but he never did.<br>

            Since then, Zero has run this tavern.
            She brews wine, listens to stories, writes letters, waits for someone.
            She says every glass of wine holds an unfinished wish. She says he promised he would return. So she named the tavern “He Said,” holding fast to that vow.
            If one day a stranger pushes open the door and orders a drink called “The Way Home,” she'll likely smile and say:
            “You're finally back.”

            <h2>Rooms Made of Dialogues</h2>
            <p>
             She always lingered too long at that liquor store.<br>
             The owner said the way she picked out bottles didn't look like she was stocking up—more like searching for a long-lost friend.<br>
             One winter, she deliberately bought a bottle of expired brandy. The bottle had cracks, and the label was blurred.
             She said it was his favorite taste—bitter, sweet, like inescapable memories.<br>
             She never sold that bottle. She simply placed it on the bottom shelf, occasionally glancing at it, as if to confirm that memory still lingered.

            <h2>That corner</h2>
            <p>
              In the corner of the bar, there was a spot like this. Bottles stood neatly arranged, tools polished to a shine.<br>
             This place never served customers, yet sometimes she would sit there alone, setting out a glass, saying nothing.<br>

             Someone asked if she was waiting for a customer. She smiled and said:<br>

            “Not a customer. An old friend.”
